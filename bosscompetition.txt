ABOUT:
The competition is held from December 2nd, 3PM to January 2nd, 3PM. 
The voting then lasts from January 2nd, 3PM, to January 14th, 3PM. 
The winners will then be announced on the Discord Server at the end of the voting process.
There will be 3 runners up, (Which will ALL be added as secret bosses in the settings in the final release), and a winner,
which will be a main story mode boss.
(PS: All time is in GMT)

The theme is Forest/Woods, where the player is in a Woodland (Chapter 3). 
You may choose to make a cutscene before the boss, (in another scene) or if wanted I can make the cutscene.
(No dialogue please, the story is communicated through movements and bounces, as a bush cannot speak.)

HOW TO MAKE:
First of all, you need to create a new blank GDevelop project.
Then rename the “Untitled Scene” to the name of your boss.
Then, go to your game’s properties, find “Project File Type” and change it from “Single file (Default)” to “Multiple files, saved in folder next to the main file.
Then get creative!
When your boss (and also cutscene, if you made one) is finished, please contact me via Discord, and I will enter it into the competition.

Thanks for reading!
